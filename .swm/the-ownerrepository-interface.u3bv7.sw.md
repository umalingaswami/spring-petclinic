This document will cover the interface <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="51:5:5" line-data="	private final OwnerRepository owners;">`OwnerRepository`</SwmToken> in the Spring PetClinic project. We will explore:

1. What <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="51:5:5" line-data="	private final OwnerRepository owners;">`OwnerRepository`</SwmToken> is and its purpose.
2. The functions defined in <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="51:5:5" line-data="	private final OwnerRepository owners;">`OwnerRepository`</SwmToken>.

# What is <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="51:5:5" line-data="	private final OwnerRepository owners;">`OwnerRepository`</SwmToken>

<SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="51:5:5" line-data="	private final OwnerRepository owners;">`OwnerRepository`</SwmToken> is an interface in the Spring PetClinic project that extends <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerRepository.java" pos="24:12:12" line-data="import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;">`JpaRepository`</SwmToken>. It is designed to manage Owner domain objects, providing methods to perform CRUD operations and queries on the Owner data. The interface adheres to Spring Data naming conventions, allowing for easy extension and integration with Spring Data JPA.

In the <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="53:3:3" line-data="	public OwnerController(OwnerRepository owners) {">`OwnerController`</SwmToken>, the <SwmToken path="src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java" pos="51:5:5" line-data="	private final OwnerRepository owners;">`OwnerRepository`</SwmToken> is used to manage owner-related operations. It is injected into the controller through its constructor, allowing the controller to interact with the data store to perform actions such as retrieving and updating owner information.

```java
	private static final String VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM = "owners/createOrUpdateOwnerForm";

	private final OwnerRepository owners;

	public OwnerController(OwnerRepository owners) {

It is injected into the controller, enabling the retrieval of owner data necessary for managing pet records.

```java
	private static final String VIEWS_PETS_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM = "pets/createOrUpdatePetForm";

	private final OwnerRepository owners;

	private final PetTypeRepository types;

	public PetController(OwnerRepository owners, PetTypeRepository types) {
