title: numbers adding in class
---
# Introduction

This document explains the implementation of a simple class that adds two numbers and prints the result. The main questions addressed are:

1. Why is the addition done inside a class with a main method?
2. How does the code flow from variable declaration to output?
3. What is the rationale behind this straightforward approach?

# code flow

The code defines a class with a main method, which is the entry point for execution in Java. Inside the main method, two integer variables are declared and initialized with fixed values. These values are then added together, and the sum is stored in another variable. Finally, the result is printed to the console with a descriptive message.

This approach keeps everything contained within a single class and method, making it easy to run and understand. It uses basic Java syntax and standard output for demonstration purposes.

```
public class AddNumbers{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int sum = a + b;
        System.out.println("The sum of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

# conclusion

The implementation is minimalistic and serves as a clear example of adding two numbers in Java. It avoids unnecessary complexity by performing all operations in the main method of a single class. This makes it suitable for simple testing or educational purposes.
